## SIMPLE HANGMAN.

The Program guesses a word among given ten words and gives a clue 
for the user by showing equal number of underscores inplace of 
number of characters.

When the user inputs a correct letter or substring that exists
in the randomly selelcted word, the program updates itself and
shows the underscores populated by the corrects letters and the 
rest by underscores.

The program allows a total of six errors in a play and after
six trail if there is any char missed from the original randomly
selected word then program terminates.
